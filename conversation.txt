00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  I can say we are at the moment in advance stage, I can say, because we've been adopting different automations.
[00:13.000 --> 00:20.000]  I have a different view from the previous panelists when we discussed about the book.
[00:20.000 --> 00:27.000]  I remember there's one of the panelists saying that automation is the same with integration.
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  For me, I see that it's a different part.
[00:30.000 --> 00:37.000]  We can, I see automation can be done in a cluster way, which that's what we did.
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  For instance, like when we are talking about a procurement process.
[00:41.000 --> 00:49.000]  Today, we are using Coupa as one of automations around the procurement world.
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.000]  We cover from the source to pay process, meaning not only procurement,
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.000]  but we also ask our colleague in AP account payable operation to also join the system
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  so that we have an end-to-end seamless process.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  A part of that, we also did integration.
[01:09.000 --> 01:15.000]  Because I think everyone has the same situations where we have different system within the company,
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  either it is legacy or even new or even a custom build.
[01:18.000 --> 01:26.000]  So we use that lever, including solutions like Brutato, to help us integrate across different systems
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  because like it or not, we are interacting with different functions within the company.
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  And it's actually beyond automation and integration that we did.
[01:36.000 --> 01:44.000]  We also already implemented, I think we are the first function in the company that implement robot.
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  So we already have robot in our vendor management.
[01:48.000 --> 01:56.000]  So basically, I can say the end-to-end onboarding process of our partners, especially in vendors area,
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  it's already can be processed on a self-service model.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  And on the back end, there will be robot, will capture any incoming process
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  and that robot will use different system instead of people.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  So that's why we have a very little operation in our vendor management side.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  And hopefully in the future, we are in the process of preparing the PRP.
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  We are going to also implement AI in our sourcing process.
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  And I can testify that after working alongside with Go2 for a while right now,
[02:33.000 --> 02:42.000]  I'm very progressive in terms of the idea about adopting automation almost company-wide at the moment.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  So over to you, Raymond.
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  So you came from a very serious background, right?
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  From consumer electronic technology, insurance, and most recently in Money Smart.
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  So can you share with us some of your observation in terms of digital adoption within the Money Smart?
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  Okay, so I joined Money Smart about eight months ago.
[03:05.000 --> 03:15.000]  So when I came in, of course, I was kind of surprised in a way that we are quite tiny adopting digital solutions.
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.000]  So it's great, but there's also a challenge because a lot of them were standalone solutions.
[03:21.000 --> 03:29.000]  So the challenge for us now is to figure out how to integrate all of them together, if we can, as far as possible.
[03:29.000 --> 03:37.000]  Because from my experience when I worked for some of the larger companies, a lot of the solutions were very integrated.
[03:37.000 --> 03:45.000]  But of course, as a small medium company, as a startup, we don't actually have the resources that all these big companies have, right?
[03:45.000 --> 03:53.000]  So we do need to kind of figure out how to manage the resources and costs accordingly while adopting digital solutions
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  and automation in an appropriate manner that actually fits our purposes, our needs.
[03:58.000 --> 04:05.000]  And also is able to help us enable the customer experience positively at the end of the day.
[04:05.000 --> 04:15.000]  So it's actually, I would say, very myriad in terms of the level of automation and adoption in the company.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  Different functions have their own solutions that they're using.
[04:20.000 --> 04:28.000]  Give you an example. If you look at HR, for example, we actually have three different subsystems to manage the hiring process,
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  to manage the payroll, and to manage expense claims.
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  Now when you look at it, is that the most efficient? The answer is probably no.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  What is the best solution? We're still kind of working on it.
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000]  So I think as you look at the experience I've had, I've been in companies like Microsoft,
[04:46.000 --> 04:54.000]  where a lot of these solutions that they have built on their own, in Microsoft they used to call it dog fooding, right?
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  So whatever they sell as a solution to customers, they like to kind of try it out themselves,
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.000]  and make sure that they use it perfectly and make sure that it works well.
[05:05.000 --> 05:12.000]  So we're looking at some of the solutions internally within MoneySpark to help us drive the level of adoption
[05:12.000 --> 05:20.000]  for digital transformation as well as automation, like some of the large companies have and are doing today.
[05:21.000 --> 05:29.000]  Thank you so much, Raymond. So what are you, you know, in your capacity working as a advisory services for your client, right?
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  So what are some of the observations among your clients?
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.000]  I think I would say we're probably two straight places on the panel.
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  But the vast majority of the enterprises that I interact with,
[05:42.000 --> 05:48.000]  they're probably still in very early stages of adopting or going on this journey.
[05:48.000 --> 05:58.000]  In most organizations, I see that almost, you know, finance, automation and transformation kind of follows the enterprise transformation model.
[05:58.000 --> 06:05.000]  And if you look at the cloud spend as a proxy for how organizations are looking at enterprise transformation,
[06:05.000 --> 06:08.000]  probably less than 6% of the global IT spent today is on cloud.
[06:08.000 --> 06:12.000]  So that kind of a reflection of how we are in the journey.
[06:12.000 --> 06:21.000]  But at the same time, I do get the opportunity to interact with CFOs from like these three major businesses as well as large enterprises.
[06:21.000 --> 06:27.000]  So it means that probably 10% of the CFOs that I interact with are in that real places space,
[06:27.000 --> 06:33.000]  probably 50 to 60% are thinking about what automation is top of mind for them.
[06:33.000 --> 06:40.000]  So they're thinking of different roles to hire in their organizations, how do you navigate the change, etc.
[06:40.000 --> 06:47.000]  So in that capacity, I did hear a comment in the morning around how CFOs should be the champions for change in the organization.
[06:47.000 --> 06:54.000]  And that's kind of the mental model that we kind of try and, you know, sort of instill in our customers as well.
[06:54.000 --> 07:03.000]  How do we how do we ensure that your right partnership between the CFO and the CIO in storing this journey together?
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.000]  How do you establish the right roles and responsibilities that need finance and IT, etc.?
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  So I would say early days, but a lot of positive momentum around this in our customers.
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  Yeah, I mean, I can echo that sentiment.
[07:20.000 --> 07:28.000]  Right. So we are a digital native company and enterprise automation and all that is kind of still new in the finance space.
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.000]  Right. So having two of you on board sharing some of those stories with us is going to be very, very beneficial for all of us.
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.000]  So and it's good to hear all this right.
[07:41.000 --> 07:51.000]  Even I think people on the ground on the floor here started your journey thinking about digital intervention for your current processes and so on.
[07:51.000 --> 07:58.000]  Are there any critical technology disruptions out there that our audience should be aware of?
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  Maybe we know you can share that.
[08:01.000 --> 08:07.000]  Sure. I'm not sure the technology disruptions because a lot of these technologies have been around for a while.
[08:07.000 --> 08:14.000]  I think there are a few that are important and should form the watchers of finance and procurement professionals.
[08:14.000 --> 08:25.000]  I mean, I think the first thing I would say is probably process mining because today a lot of enterprises are struggling to understand where inefficiencies lie in their processes.
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.000]  They don't even know what the baseline is for them to make a change.
[08:29.000 --> 08:44.000]  So having process mining and process mining tools built into their system to sort of understand inefficiencies give real time insights on where they can potentially access automation and drive change within their organization is obviously quite critical.
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  It gives you a baseline for you to make change to begin with.
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  Donald kind of spoke about robotics. Obviously RPA has a huge role to play in finance.
[08:53.000 --> 09:02.000]  A lot of the finance workloads can be automated because they are rule based, they are repetitive, which means you don't have any manual intervention to this.
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.000]  RPA obviously has a huge role to play there.
[09:05.000 --> 09:19.000]  And we've heard AI all the way through and obviously AI combined with RPA has implications across, you know, in finance the use cases can be intelligent process, intelligent document processing or conversational AI.
[09:19.000 --> 09:28.000]  Or for that matter, you know, today we are living in the world of generative AI where we are getting co-agents to sort of help us in our day-to-day processes.
[09:28.000 --> 09:43.000]  So, and I think the last thing I would mention is I think low-code and no-code apps do have a role to play in finance because digital skills are probably one of the big challenges that CFOs and finance leaders face today.
[09:43.000 --> 09:51.000]  And, you know, low-code and no-code apps are lowering the bar for the level of technology skills that are needed in the finance function as well.
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  So I would say these are some of the areas that the finance leaders of today should be looking at.
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  Thanks so much. And we did our own survey as well last year.
[10:01.000 --> 10:16.000]  And based on the survey conducted by us and looking at all sorts of automation and the plans for people to kick off their automation, right, the main area where we see most potential in finance automation is the digital suspect, right?
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.000]  The order to cash, you know, the book you ought to pay, financial reporting is a big one.
[10:21.000 --> 10:27.000]  And I wonder, you know, the other day I was talking to Raymond, Raymond tell me the fourth one, right, on claims and so on.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  And you also see Dr. Eaton earlier that run through some of it.
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  So I will have my colleague help me out at the moment.
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  This is going to run through, you get your money.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  So this is the first event that we give you money when you join the event.
[10:42.000 --> 10:57.000]  So you dropped it in the book in front and let us know, like, where do you think you will spend your money, you know, in either one of these or the fourth category others?
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  The first one who come on board will have a special price.
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  Would that help? Yeah.
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  Yeah, if you want to just raise your hand.
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  Anybody on, for example, order to cash?
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  Will you put your money on order to cash?
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  No.
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  Yeah.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  What about, let's say, procure to pay anybody?
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.000]  Oh, yeah, we have one procure to pay.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  Can you help me remember this gentleman?
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  He's going to get a special price here.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  Procure to pay, that's interesting.
[11:39.000 --> 11:46.000]  Yeah, would you like to share why procure to pay?
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  I think I'll give an answer first on why I didn't just order to cash.
[11:51.000 --> 11:59.000]  I'm in the online game industry, so most of our customers are actually people all over the world and we deal digitally.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  So we deal with digital goods and we have a very good payment system.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  So we don't need to deliver any tangible products.
[12:07.000 --> 12:19.000]  And the reason why procure to pay is one of the biggest challenges that we have is we are a global company and we have 3,500 employees and we are spread all over the world.
[12:19.000 --> 12:27.000]  And we have purchasing being done almost every day in hundreds and thousands of dollars.
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.000]  And the difficulty we face is that because we have different infrastructures being set up because of legacy.
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  We have a different HRM system.
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.000]  We have a different database that we need to buy.
[12:43.000 --> 12:49.000]  We have the IT and then we have finance and we have AP and all of these systems doesn't talk to each other.
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  And because of that, whenever we have purchases, again, although we are a big company,
[12:54.000 --> 13:01.000]  we still like a mom and pop that we have to issue a purchase requisition and this has to go to the approval process.
[13:01.000 --> 13:11.000]  And most of the time, the rules of the CFO is always viewed as very bureaucratic and people just override the CFO and just go and buy.
[13:11.000 --> 13:19.000]  And because of this, we have so much trouble when it goes to the finance and the finance will ask, where's your approval?
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  And we always say, you know, we don't have it.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  Or it was given, but it was given verbally or it was given to a WhatsApp message.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  So it's a challenge that we face.
[13:27.000 --> 13:39.000]  And I'm really interested to know how Donald managed to overcome this or Mr. Raymond, how he managed to overcome this.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  Yeah, yeah, if I may, let me start.
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  So basically, from my end, I was quite lucky.
[13:47.000 --> 13:51.000]  So maybe if I can share a bit about my journey.
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  So this is my first technology company.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  I've been in Gotu for five years.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  I was coming from Gojek side.
[13:59.000 --> 14:10.000]  So before the mega merger with Tokopedia, when I joined, I was the fourth oldest people in that company.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  So it's so young.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  So most of them are young.
[14:13.000 --> 14:34.000]  So and my boss at that time, he was the CFO of Commonwealth Indonesia, also being recruited by Gojek at the time to help and prepare Gojek for IPO.
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  So he asked me to help him.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  And I joined Gojek.
[14:39.000 --> 14:51.000]  And that's actually the first fundamental, I believe, that is essential where the procurement will need to tightly partnering with the finance leader.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  Because otherwise, it's going to be a headache.
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.000]  Like you mentioned, it's the same situation that we are dealing before.
[14:59.000 --> 15:07.000]  People are just buying things or crazy stuff happen like buying company asset using personal credit card.
[15:07.000 --> 15:16.000]  And God knows how the accountant can start calculating the asset depreciation or something.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  So even it was a jungle.
[15:19.000 --> 15:27.000]  But brick by brick, we built all the governance, we built all the policy and the procedure.
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.000]  And I believe I support you.
[15:31.000 --> 15:41.000]  We are implementing on the procurement system, which is, I believe, a procurement system is actually one of the big vein of the organization body.
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  So ERP, I would imagine, would be the heart.
[15:45.000 --> 15:52.000]  But yes, we need the vein to work properly connecting different organs in the organizations.
[15:52.000 --> 16:05.000]  Basically, we inject everything, the governance, the policy, the procedure into the system so that we don't need people to man guard the expense.
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.000]  Instead, the system will automatically put everyone.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  It's like a rat.
[16:10.000 --> 16:11.000]  Pardon my language.
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  It's like a rat in a maze.
[16:13.000 --> 16:21.000]  So you just need to walk through the maze that we already created and it will end up on the right exit that we want you to go.
[16:21.000 --> 16:26.000]  So that's how we design the process together with the finance.
[16:26.000 --> 16:36.000]  Did you use Urkato to address that or did you build a custom built solution for that?
[16:36.000 --> 16:50.000]  So before, unfortunately, our CIO is not fully aware about Urkato until I think the last three to four years.
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.000]  Then we realized about Urkato and then moved most of our integration.
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.000]  Because it's a headache, right?
[16:56.000 --> 17:04.000]  When you build so many integrations and then you go straight to host to host API and then some things came up.
[17:04.000 --> 17:13.000]  There's an enhancement, for instance, like the other person from Jolibi explained how he will migrate from ECC to S4HANA.
[17:13.000 --> 17:19.000]  I already imagine if you don't have Urkato in between, it will be a huge headache.
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.000]  Yeah, nice analogy about the rat in the maze.
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.000]  So I think my view is the following.
[17:29.000 --> 17:34.000]  I'm coming from a lot of different experiences and what works best.
[17:34.000 --> 17:39.000]  I think it starts with people, process and then technology as an enabler.
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  So people really all about the culture and it starts from the top.
[17:43.000 --> 17:53.000]  So the executive management has to drive the message to adhere to policies and compliance, right?
[17:53.000 --> 18:01.000]  Processes and rules are defined to support the organization's objective, right?
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  For example, you have a budget that you set.
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.000]  You have to follow the budget.
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.000]  You can't overspend.
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  If you overspend, that will be a problem, right?
[18:07.000 --> 18:12.000]  For listed companies and public companies, you are accountable to your shareholders.
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  So you always have to make sure you manage that.
[18:14.000 --> 18:18.000]  Now, technology, I think it's a way for you to create that maze, right?
[18:18.000 --> 18:25.000]  To box and create limitations for the rat to move where they can when you let it go.
[18:25.000 --> 18:34.000]  And that's the, I think the fundamental is really about using technology to enable the process so that you can actually drive that.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  Just a disclaimer.
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  Manish Bhai is not a customer of Urkato yet.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  We are exploring.
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.000]  Let's see how it goes.
[18:43.000 --> 18:47.000]  I mean, I first heard about Urkato probably about four or five months ago.
[18:47.000 --> 18:53.000]  We've been having a bit of conversation, sharing some of my vision and the company's direction as well.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  Let's see where things will go from here.
[18:55.000 --> 19:04.000]  But I think when you go on an automation journey, automation will help you solve some of the issue on people not following rules.
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  Because at the end of the day, there's no other way, right?
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  It should be very digital, one on zero, right?
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  Either it's approved or it's not approved.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  It's either a rule or not a rule, right?
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  You can have some exceptions to it.
[19:16.000 --> 19:25.000]  And that's where I think automation will solve 95 percent of manual work when it's rule based, process driven.
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  And the other five percent is judgment, right?
[19:27.000 --> 19:35.000]  And humans still need to make judgment calls in some of the areas, such as spending and procurement.
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  Yeah, and I think I agree with that.
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.000]  I mean, regardless how much we automate and all that implementing various forms of AI and so on,
[19:44.000 --> 19:53.000]  I think over and over again, we understand that there's still that five percent of validation, judgment and all that human needs to be put.
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  So can you bring me to the next question?
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  I think a lot of people will be quite interested to know about this as well.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  For example, in procurement, it's such a critical function within the organization, right?
[20:05.000 --> 20:06.000]  What are some of the priorities?
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.000]  What are some of the cool stuff that is coming up for you in the next 12 to 18 months?
[20:12.000 --> 20:19.000]  So like I mentioned, AI is one of the key areas that we believe can help us a lot.
[20:19.000 --> 20:29.000]  And like many other procurement processes, especially when we talk about sourcing processes, including negotiation,
[20:29.000 --> 20:35.000]  it's heavily relying on human, human driven kind of process.
[20:35.000 --> 20:42.000]  So that's why we're trying to break the puzzle and see which puzzle that can be fitted into AI.
[20:42.000 --> 20:49.000]  For instance, we already have in our pipeline to migrate the scoring process
[20:49.000 --> 20:56.000]  so that whenever someone trying to prepare a sourcing process for a specific category,
[20:56.000 --> 21:03.000]  the AI will be able to generate the criteria, including the weightage for that bidding process
[21:03.000 --> 21:07.000]  so that we can skip the process of designing a scorecard.
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  So that's the easiest way to implement it.
[21:09.000 --> 21:18.000]  And then later on, we will also build a more advanced AI to help us to construct the documentations
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.000]  because we need to wrap up every sourcing process, we need to wrap up the bidding result,
[21:23.000 --> 21:32.000]  especially maybe similar to e-money business, because one of our GoTo companies, Gopay, is quite highly regulated.
[21:32.000 --> 21:37.000]  So we make sure that we kept our documentation very high.
[21:37.000 --> 21:42.000]  And this is where usually the team will consume quite sometimes.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  And this is where we want for AI to help us.
[21:46.000 --> 21:52.000]  And then because we just also recently acquired a logistic company,
[21:52.000 --> 21:58.000]  and it will soon also be coming to my shop actually,
[21:58.000 --> 22:05.000]  and we want to make sure that we are ready to have an automated ordering process
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.000]  because we know we have so many inventory in that area.
[22:09.000 --> 22:16.000]  So we are preparing automation and integration to support the automatic ordering,
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  including the automating the VMI process, the federal managed inventory,
[22:21.000 --> 22:31.000]  so that we can help the finance leader to suppress the needs of working capital sitting in our inventory.
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  Thank you so much, Donald.
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  What about you, Vinu, among all your customers and all,
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.000]  do you see some of the priorities coming up from the CFO?
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.000]  I don't address some of it, but I think when it comes to procurement,
[22:49.000 --> 22:54.000]  what we are seeing, something interesting that's come up, is the role of private marketplaces in procurement,
[22:54.000 --> 23:00.000]  where in a lot of the software procurement that's happening for enterprises are becoming automated in a way
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.000]  where using standardized contracts on a private marketplace, such as the AWS Marketplace,
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  there's a private bidding process that's happening.
[23:08.000 --> 23:15.000]  The ISV ecosystem, such as WorkCenter, for example, are offering private offers on the marketplace
[23:15.000 --> 23:21.000]  that are custom made for your customers.
[23:21.000 --> 23:26.000]  So that's an evolution we are seeing specifically on procurement for that matter.
[23:26.000 --> 23:32.000]  I think CFO, I think kind of addressed this earlier as well,
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  but like I said, the skills requirement are definitely changing for the CFO.
[23:36.000 --> 23:43.000]  I mean, increasingly I'm hearing a lot of customers talking about how they need data scientists in their team,
[23:43.000 --> 23:50.000]  or people are conversant with business transformation or product transformation in general.
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  That's the kind of skill set that's getting appreciated.
[23:53.000 --> 23:58.000]  So it's not a pure FP&A, finance kind of skill set that's getting that.
[23:58.000 --> 24:02.000]  Equal requirements are definitely changing for the CFO.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  What about you, Raymond?
[24:04.000 --> 24:11.000]  I mean, on the finance side, there are quite a lot of repetitive, template-based kind of processes, right?
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  So what will be some of the priorities coming up for you then?
[24:15.000 --> 24:20.000]  I think you have to start with the end in mind when you're trying to achieve, right?
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  So I think we talked about this briefly.
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.000]  My vision is, I think, is to get to it one day close, for example.
[24:28.000 --> 24:37.000]  That might be a very big ambition and goal, but if this was 10 years ago, I would probably have said that's not possible.
[24:37.000 --> 24:44.000]  But we live in an era where technology can be a very big enabler for this.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  The infrastructure, we've got 5G on mobile.
[24:47.000 --> 24:54.000]  You can actually do approvals and things anywhere, anytime, as long as the signals and reliability is there.
[24:54.000 --> 25:03.000]  You've got things which are now on the cloud, which 10 years ago probably the rate of upload is much slower than now,
[25:03.000 --> 25:06.000]  but now you can kind of upload and download things much quicker.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  So I think technology as an enabler can actually help drive that.
[25:10.000 --> 25:19.000]  If you think about my priorities for a company as a starting point, we touched briefly on that earlier.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  You look at RPA and you look at AI.
[25:21.000 --> 25:32.000]  If you bring the two together, it can become a very powerful tool for the company in terms of how you actually navigate a business.
[25:32.000 --> 25:40.000]  So when you look at repetitive processes, rule-based types of processes and transactions,
[25:40.000 --> 25:47.000]  one of the things that I would like to do for my team is to get the team to move away from manual transaction processing
[25:47.000 --> 25:54.000]  and automate straight-through processing as far as possible, and then close the books as quickly as we can,
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  and then use AI to do forecasting FPNA and some of the more predictive analytics
[26:00.000 --> 26:06.000]  and create a business intelligence solution that can actually drive actionable insights with the company.
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  Now what that can do is help you to make much quicker, faster, real-time, instant decisions.
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  Nowadays, business moves at faster speed.
[26:17.000 --> 26:26.000]  Decisions need to be made much quicker, and that's kind of where as a CFO, as a finance leader, my role is to help ensure that.
[26:26.000 --> 26:33.000]  There's some interesting things that are happening right now where people are saying that the role of the finance function
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  and the role of the CFO is no longer on finance alone, it's more on value.
[26:38.000 --> 26:42.000]  How do you actually create value? How do you actually protect value?
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.000]  And that's kind of where this whole function encompasses, and don't touch a bit about procurement as well.
[26:48.000 --> 26:55.000]  So some of the things around procurement that actually you can kind of set up to do negotiation processes,
[26:55.000 --> 27:02.000]  much more streamlined, for example, and even down to contracts and agreements that can be standardized
[27:02.000 --> 27:10.000]  when the vendor is approved, you send them a contract automatically, right?
[27:10.000 --> 27:16.000]  And so that whole process can actually be streamlined through rule base, obviously,
[27:16.000 --> 27:26.000]  and then as you kind of build in the robotic process automation, that actually kind of helps you to select vendors and shortlist them.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  All these in 12 to 18 months, that is going to be a challenge, isn't it?
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  It is.
[27:33.000 --> 27:40.000]  So, I mean, I hear about all these really exciting priorities and all that, but all of us have bosses, isn't it?
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  We have investors, we have shareholders and all that to report to.
[27:44.000 --> 27:52.000]  What would be the strongest business driver for you to push some of these important priorities through?
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  And looking at it right now in the current climate,
[27:55.000 --> 28:03.000]  what would be the payback period that you think that your bosses out there will be expecting?
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  Yeah, for me, my direction is clear.
[28:07.000 --> 28:15.000]  Not only that, I think this will also result in similar industry, especially in the technology industry,
[28:15.000 --> 28:23.000]  whereby we are not only conventionally calculating the biggest ROI,
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  but unfortunately, we need to also factor in the fastest ROI.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  So it's a different game.
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.000]  There are additional parameters that we need to measure.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  So not educating on how different...
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  Yeah, in procurement, we are buying so many solutions for different functions, right?
[28:41.000 --> 28:50.000]  But part of our responsibility to also educate them on how to use that tools properly, which is calculate the ROI.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  For instance, we have a Workato already in the house, right?
[28:54.000 --> 29:00.000]  Everyone can go to the CIO and ask, hey, we want to have a Workato here, Workato there.
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.000]  But who will measure the ROI and how fast?
[29:04.000 --> 29:12.000]  Because everyone always say that we have engineer bandwidth, we have engineer constraints, so everyone is skewing.
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.000]  So they need to know which one they need to prioritize.
[29:15.000 --> 29:23.000]  So this is where we need to clear guidance, not only the value, but also the fastest ROI.
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.000]  Yeah, I do agree. I think it's probably about the fastest ROI.
[29:30.000 --> 29:35.000]  And when you talk about ROI, it's sometimes not just about cost savings, right?
[29:35.000 --> 29:39.000]  Because a lot of times when you look at automation, you look at it from a cost savings angle.
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  But a lot of times it's also about cost avoidance.
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.000]  Can you do more with the same resources that you have?
[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  And for a company like ours, we are growing, we are scaling.
[29:50.000 --> 29:55.000]  We're looking to expand, and you can't have infinite resources to expand.
[29:55.000 --> 30:01.000]  We need to kind of figure out how to expand with the existing resources that we have.
[30:01.000 --> 30:04.000]  How do we actually process more transactions?
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.000]  How do we manage the growth?
[30:06.000 --> 30:13.000]  How do we deal with more partners without adding exceptionally too many resources as well?
[30:13.000 --> 30:16.000]  And I think when you look at the returns from a value perspective,
[30:16.000 --> 30:19.000]  like I mentioned earlier, it's about value creation, right?
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.000]  It's not just about cost sometimes, it's about how fast you can grow the company,
[30:22.000 --> 30:27.000]  what kind of additional revenue streams you get out of some of these automations.
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  So I'll give an example.
[30:30.000 --> 30:39.000]  If we were to, let's say, streamline and integrate and automate the sales-related function,
[30:39.000 --> 30:43.000]  software and automation, with finance, right?
[30:43.000 --> 30:52.000]  And use some of the RPA or even AI to predict some of the funnels or the velocity of sales,
[30:52.000 --> 30:58.000]  we can actually find ways for the marketing team then to go back to the customers and engage them
[30:58.000 --> 31:02.000]  and probably get a conversion into sales at the end of the day.
[31:02.000 --> 31:05.000]  So some of these, even outside of the finance area,
[31:05.000 --> 31:10.000]  so the way I view it is that it's not just about finance, it's organization-wide.
[31:10.000 --> 31:18.000]  So the kind of approach that you take has to be more organization-wide rather than functional driven.
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.000]  And finance is probably the heart of all this, right?
[31:21.000 --> 31:27.000]  And you are interrelated with almost every single different stakeholder within the organization.
[31:27.000 --> 31:32.000]  So we talk about benefits, we talk about priorities, we also talk about drivers right now.
[31:32.000 --> 31:37.000]  The next question is, I get asked a lot, but automation is almost like a bad word sometimes.
[31:37.000 --> 31:43.000]  When you talk about automation, you talk about the unavoidable fear,
[31:43.000 --> 31:46.000]  about the impact on job security and all that.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  I'm not going to talk about that.
[31:48.000 --> 31:59.000]  But I would like to see that while greater use of automation has implications on changing the profile of the finance function
[31:59.000 --> 32:08.000]  and also the team size, but it can also open up new roles, new skills, new profiles for the finance organization.
[32:09.000 --> 32:19.000]  What are some of the skills that you observe will be important in your particular specific area of work moving forward?
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  Mino, you want to start first?
[32:21.000 --> 32:27.000]  Like I mentioned, I think I'm increasingly seeing customers obviously hide differently in their finance functions.
[32:38.000 --> 32:47.000]  But more importantly, I think one thing I want to address is you sort of spoke earlier in the room where automation does that right, job posts, etc.
[32:47.000 --> 32:54.000]  The way we've been sort of working with our customers and what I tend to see more often is that most organizations are growing
[32:54.000 --> 32:58.000]  and they need workforce requirements that grow once a year.
[32:58.000 --> 33:06.000]  So as automation drives efficiency, if you have an appropriate workforce transformation,
[33:06.000 --> 33:14.000]  it means that the people who are doing such jobs that are not potentially strategic or more tactical today
[33:14.000 --> 33:19.000]  can move into areas that are delivering more strategic value to the business.
[33:19.000 --> 33:28.000]  So having that workforce transformation plan and that vision, that talk down, definitely changes things from a workforce plan.
[33:33.000 --> 33:41.000]  Yeah, I agree. I think like I mentioned, it starts from the thought it's people and process and then technology to enable that.
[33:41.000 --> 33:48.000]  And when you think about what's coming ahead, what's going to change, you really need to think ahead.
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  And like what you said, upscaling is one of the major areas to consider.
[33:53.000 --> 34:00.000]  And if you look at how finance will hire differently down the road, I think data scientists is for sure one.
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.000]  I mean, as you move away from the reputative transactional processes to get automated,
[34:06.000 --> 34:15.000]  you need people who are then going to be able to understand data, learn how to analyze it, and then make that judgment.
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.000]  So the 5% is really about the judgment and really it's all about data identity.
[34:19.000 --> 34:27.000]  And when you move away from backward-looking type of processes to a more forward-looking, for example, FP&A processes,
[34:28.000 --> 34:36.000]  and looking at forecasting, looking at understanding the business and creating insights and generating actionable insights for the business
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.000]  to basically act on and deliver more revenue and growth and value to the organization,
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  you will need a different kind of skill set from this.
[34:47.000 --> 34:57.000]  A majority of my career has been in FP&A, and it wasn't just understanding the basic accounting standards and debits and credits.
[34:57.000 --> 35:07.000]  It was also about understanding how to use data, how to understand and transform the data into meaningful information and insights
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  for the business to be able to use to drive the business forward.
[35:11.000 --> 35:16.000]  So I think the skill sets that are going to be required are going to be different.
[35:16.000 --> 35:23.000]  I think, therefore, the way that we view and the way that I view the hiring in the resourcing space
[35:23.000 --> 35:32.000]  will definitely move away from some of the transactional and more towards data-related and a bit of combination of tech.
[35:32.000 --> 35:40.000]  Data science, maybe some tech skills, even though we are going to move to a slow-code, no-code type of environment, right?
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.000]  I'd just like to add something to automation is a bad word for finance, right?
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.000]  So if you... Okay, let me just introduce myself. I'm Danish. I'm from the product team of 5ADS.
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.000]  We are trying to solve problems for the office of the CFO.
[35:58.000 --> 36:04.000]  What we have seen is Microsoft Excel is the most used product in the office of the CFO, right?
[36:04.000 --> 36:09.000]  It's a pretty simple UI. It gives flexibility to a finance user, right?
[36:09.000 --> 36:16.000]  But when you try to automate stuff for a finance user, that if you look at from an accountant's lens,
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.000]  evaluating whether automation, whatever automation has done, is it accurate, is it correct, right?
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.000]  Is it going to report the correct financial numbers for us, right?
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.000]  The more and more we try to automate, it becomes a black hole for an accountant, right?
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  Not getting visibility, is it correct, is it good, bad, accurate, right?
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  So that's a pretty... Yeah, I'd say I'm in line with you.
[36:37.000 --> 36:44.000]  Yeah, automation is a bad word for a finance user, and that's a problem to solve for companies, right?
[36:44.000 --> 36:51.000]  With a simpler UI, simpler experience, right? Just like Excel, how do you make an accountant understand
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  how to automate the value of doing things that way?
[36:55.000 --> 37:02.000]  Well, I think it depends. There will be different tools that you need to use for different purposes,
[37:02.000 --> 37:09.000]  I would say, right? I'll just share, for example, we don't use Excel in MoneySpun.
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  We use Google Sheets, and that's one of my challenges as well, right?
[37:13.000 --> 37:23.000]  I'm trying to figure out what's the best value and most efficient solution for the company as a whole,
[37:23.000 --> 37:28.000]  and there will be challenges that you face along the way, and I don't think automation is a bad word.
[37:28.000 --> 37:38.000]  I think it's an enabler, so I see it positively, an enabler for change, to transform, to move forward and do more.
[37:39.000 --> 37:44.000]  And it starts with that, we shouldn't be afraid of change.
[37:44.000 --> 37:52.000]  I think if any organization or any employee is afraid of change and automation and the fear of losing their jobs,
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  then that eventually will happen, right?
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  I think if you, and fear is not a bad thing, fear is a good thing, I think, right?
[38:00.000 --> 38:09.000]  So if you fear something, you will take an action to kind of evolve and change and make sure that doesn't happen to you, right?
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  Thank you.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  Donald, do you have anything to add?
[38:14.000 --> 38:22.000]  If I could follow up on that, so I think that's a great answer, but we do run into a situation where they do want to automate,
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.000]  but it's so Excel heavy, what would you advise?
[38:27.000 --> 38:33.000]  Do you have to kind of go through a massive transformation and go away from Google Sheets or Excel?
[38:33.000 --> 38:43.000]  Are there things, even though you're so Excel-based, what type of automation can still happen in that phase?
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.000]  Are there examples of anything you've used, like while you have so much Google Sheets,
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  what have you done, because that's something we hear from customers pretty often.
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.000]  Right, so again, I go back to process, right?
[38:57.000 --> 39:05.000]  So the way that I think for me, if I were to do a transformation journey like it's mine right now,
[39:05.000 --> 39:12.000]  we will go back to the drawing board, we will redesign the process, we will understand the process all over again,
[39:12.000 --> 39:19.000]  and then figure out what automation is currently existing and what is on Excel, for example,
[39:19.000 --> 39:26.000]  and then look at solutions which are there to replace maybe Excel for some of the workflows.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  I'm not saying that you don't use Excel at all.
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  I'm just saying that maybe it's not the answer to everything.
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  And then find a way to perhaps even integrate it all.
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  Maybe there's no solution out there right now for anything that's Excel-based in the process that you're doing.
[39:40.000 --> 39:48.000]  And that is more how you actually integrate it into different processes or systems along the way, right?
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.000]  And then basically understanding that you have an existing BAU that you have to manage,
[39:54.000 --> 40:03.000]  maybe create a safe environment and a sandbox for you to experiment in order for you to make sure that you are successful in that transformation
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  before you completely switch over and cut it off, right?
[40:10.000 --> 40:15.000]  Yeah, it's a very interesting conversation that I would love to respond to.
[40:15.000 --> 40:25.000]  But going back to the initial question, I believe the skill set that is required not only by finance leaders or even my self-procurement, right?
[40:25.000 --> 40:33.000]  I think this is something that all function, all professionals in different functions should have.
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.000]  Unfortunately, you need to have that tech savvy.
[40:38.000 --> 40:49.000]  You need to have a bit of ability to absorb what technology is available out there and how and where to use them.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  We heard a good presentation from Fullerton Health.
[40:54.000 --> 41:03.000]  I think it's a common problem where unfortunately, even though you have no understanding about the tech people's language,
[41:03.000 --> 41:09.000]  especially us from the business, maybe we do not understand those tech guys are talking about, right?
[41:09.000 --> 41:18.000]  And they will usually send some of the business analysts in the middle to help reach us and the tech guy.
[41:18.000 --> 41:27.000]  But because of this, business analysts usually come from more technology-driven kind of talent.
[41:27.000 --> 41:34.000]  It doesn't help you to design the right way that you want, especially for the long term.
[41:34.000 --> 41:45.000]  So this is where it becomes handy when you as the owner of the process also have that ability to know what solution out there available and how to implement it.
[41:45.000 --> 41:51.000]  And not only building the automation or integration that you want at the time,
[41:51.000 --> 41:57.000]  but you also already have a vision of what will be the road for the future.
[41:57.000 --> 42:07.000]  For instance, it's a good thing people here are talking about how finance people love Excel, right?
[42:07.000 --> 42:16.000]  Closing time is one of the key indicators usually chased by a finance leader for us to shorten.
[42:16.000 --> 42:28.000]  I think we need to break into puzzles and understand which process that actually took so many resources and execute accordingly based on sequence.
[42:28.000 --> 42:46.000]  For instance, some companies may have a huge, not only some, I think most companies have huge weight, especially on finance, let's say on the reconciliation.
[42:46.000 --> 42:57.000]  Different kind of reconciliation between the bank to the product, between GL to product processor, ERP to product processor.
[42:57.000 --> 43:02.000]  So many kind of reconciliation to make sure that everything is intact, right?
[43:02.000 --> 43:09.000]  And those are usually the area that actually people love to use Excel.
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  They love to, you know, hit to data and then try to reconcile and see.
[43:15.000 --> 43:21.000]  And then after that, they took like another week to find a because this data is not tally with this one.
[43:21.000 --> 43:28.000]  So there I think we can use there are so many engines that actually build out there.
[43:28.000 --> 43:38.000]  And this is where that finance person have that need to have that ability to identify all this type of reconciliation.
[43:38.000 --> 43:44.000]  You need to have this kind of solution and how to integrate because reconciliation is only an engine, right?
[43:44.000 --> 43:50.000]  You need to be able to integrate between your banks or even with your ERP.
[43:50.000 --> 43:55.000]  So again, I think that's where Volkato will become very handy.
[43:55.000 --> 44:02.000]  Yeah, actually, one of our biggest use case is about integrating two Excel spreadsheets.
[44:02.000 --> 44:05.000]  That's always the first one.
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  So I have a question for you.
[44:07.000 --> 44:12.000]  So I run the corporate finance for C.E.A.J. and also E.A.J.
[44:12.000 --> 44:18.000]  So I wanted to take your thoughts around automation, E.I. in relation to, you know, this E.A.J. thing
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  so a lot of companies are doing this E.A.J.
[44:20.000 --> 44:25.000]  How do you take procurement also in a lot of E.A.J. logistics and all that?
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.000]  How are you thinking about automation and E.I.A.J.
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  It's kind of...
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  It's a good question.
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  So I think when you look at ESG, let's talk first about governance, right?
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.000]  I think governance is where E.I. and automation can come in
[44:58.000 --> 45:01.000]  because it's all about compliance also.
[45:01.000 --> 45:06.000]  So when you talk about, and I shared with you the one day closing vision, right?
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  That's part of ESG governance, right?
[45:10.000 --> 45:18.000]  So if a company is able to successfully close their financials and report their financials
[45:18.000 --> 45:24.000]  much quicker and more accurately in a cost-effective manner, right?
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  That is already a big check to the ESG.
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.000]  And I think when you look at automation and E.I. to drive business,
[45:32.000 --> 45:38.000]  managing costs, managing profitability, managing growth and value, right?
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  It's all about sustainability.
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  So sustainability is not just environment, right?
[45:42.000 --> 45:49.000]  It's also about how a business can continue, how it can basically create more value for shareholders,
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.000]  create more value for employees, create more value for the society, right?
[45:53.000 --> 45:59.000]  So as an organization, if you're able to spend less on some of these processes
[45:59.000 --> 46:03.000]  and have more budgets allocated to taking care of your employees,
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.000]  that would be a no-brainer, right?
[46:06.000 --> 46:11.000]  And that's kind of like where we try to, obviously as finance leaders, you struggle a bit
[46:11.000 --> 46:15.000]  because you have the left hand, which is I need to report to my shareholders
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  any direction that I drive value and profitability.
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.000]  On the other hand, I have to take care of what matters most,
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  which is your employees, which are not a lot of organizations.
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.000]  They are our biggest assets, right?
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.000]  But if they are your biggest assets, why are they not in your balance sheet, right?
[46:32.000 --> 46:37.000]  So I think that's kind of like where the two hands need to kind of come together.
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.000]  So ESG and not all companies have a direct engage on the environment side of it.
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.000]  But I do believe that if you can automate, you can go digital,
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  you basically become capitalist, right?
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.000]  So that's one.
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.000]  But as you go through the procurement function,
[46:55.000 --> 47:02.000]  in terms of how you evaluate vendors which provide cloud-based services to you,
[47:02.000 --> 47:07.000]  are they also doing it in an efficient manner, in a green manner, right?
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.000]  And in a manner that's basically environmentally sensitive, right?
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.000]  I think that's kind of all of those need to be considered as well.
[47:17.000 --> 47:25.000]  Yeah, I think Raymond already pointed out one important stage in the lifecycle of procurement process,
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.000]  which is when we start engaging vendors, right?
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  That is where the ESG already start to tap in.
[47:33.000 --> 47:41.000]  Because like it or not, I think our investor is quite highly demanding on this area,
[47:41.000 --> 47:48.000]  especially because Goto Company is based in the US.
[47:48.000 --> 47:56.000]  So regularly every year, the question that I have from the investor every time there's an audit is always around ESG.
[47:56.000 --> 48:05.000]  And yeah, we always capture that responsibility starting from our engagement with the vendors with the right assessment,
[48:05.000 --> 48:12.000]  making sure that they are aligned with the values of ESG that we already have as a corporate.
[48:12.000 --> 48:21.000]  And then at the end, we also support because we do have specific function that manage the company ESG.
[48:21.000 --> 48:28.000]  We help them to tap the right information, especially to measures the carbon footprint.
[48:28.000 --> 48:41.000]  So that's why we build the integrations that we need so that easily AI can capture what kind of transactions that falls under this under this ESG responsibility
[48:41.000 --> 48:47.000]  and pull it into one report with the integration that we build.
[48:48.000 --> 48:56.000]  I think just from a cloud perspective, obviously this is a direct linkage that is there from a sustainability angle.
[48:56.000 --> 49:03.000]  I think there have been several third-party studies that say that running a data center on cloud is almost,
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  on Amazon at least, is almost 80% more efficient than a traditional on-prem data center,
[49:07.000 --> 49:13.000]  which means every time you're moving your infrastructure to AWS, you're having direct sustainability.
[49:13.000 --> 49:18.000]  Now, how we've been helping customers today, especially with all of the ESG reporting is,
[49:18.000 --> 49:28.000]  one, we have an ability to tell them before you even think of a transformation on AWS as to what's the carbon footprint for them as they think about the transformation.
[49:28.000 --> 49:36.000]  Now, in addition, Amazon has signed up to the climate pledge and we are on a path to being 100% renewable energy by 2025,
[49:36.000 --> 49:48.000]  so which means we have an ability to predict for our customers what their sustainability impact as we progress towards our goals and as they increase their workloads on AWS.
[49:48.000 --> 49:56.000]  Now, in addition to that, we've tried a lot of technology innovation where infrastructure is becoming extremely power efficient,
[49:56.000 --> 50:06.000]  which means there's a direct linkage to certain proprietary infrastructure being used and how sustainability impacts them.
[50:06.000 --> 50:13.000]  So I think we're helping customers in a few different ways. Sustainability has become a pillar for our better architecture framework,
[50:13.000 --> 50:22.000]  which means that we're helping our customers understand what the sustainability footprint of architecting something on the cloud and how can you be more efficient about it.
[50:22.000 --> 50:27.000]  So those are some of the ways we're directly helping our customers from a sustainability standpoint.
[50:27.000 --> 50:33.000]  Thank you. And now I'd like to open the questions to the audience here.
[50:33.000 --> 50:41.000]  Do you have any questions that you would like to pose to any of the panellists?
[50:41.000 --> 50:49.000]  Anyone?
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  We have one.
